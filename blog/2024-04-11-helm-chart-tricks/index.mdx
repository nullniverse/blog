_Some trick to alleviate the daily Helm burden of managing multiple equal resources in your deployments._

<!--truncate-->

---

I've been writing a little bit of Helm chart code for my job, because a lot of deployments are outdated and we are migrating our CI/CD pipelines from Drone.io to ArgoCD.

Modularity and flow control is a must in order to avoid complexity.

Let's go to the example. Below is a modified Ingress recipe template for k8s:

```jsx title="Ingress modified Helm templating" showLineNumbers
{{- $svcPort := .Values.service.port -}}
{{- if .Values.ingresses.enabled -}}
{{- range .Values.ingresses.ingress }}
// highlight-next-line

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: {{ .name }}
  namespace: {{ .namespace }}
  labels:
{{ include "app.labels" $ | indent 4 }}
  {{- with .annotations }}
  annotations:
    {{- toYaml . | nindent 4 }}
  {{- end }}
spec:
{{- if .tls }}
  tls:
  {{- range .tls }}
    - hosts:
    {{- range .hosts }}
      - {{ . | quote }}
    {{- end }}
      secretName: {{ .secretName }}
  {{- end }}
{{- end }}
  rules:
{{- range .rules }}
    - host: {{ .hosts | quote }}
      http:
      {{- range .http.paths }}
        paths:
          - path: {{ .path | quote }}
            pathType: {{ .pathType | quote }}
            backend:
              service:
                name: {{ .backend.service.name | quote }}
                port:
                  number: {{ .backend.service.port.number | default $svcPort }}   
      {{- end }}  
{{- end }}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}
```

Note the highlighted line above (4), that allows it to iterate during resource creation generating multiple objects.

It's not only following the API structure for the networking.k8s.io/v1 ingress kind, but it's also modular enough so you can attach and remove ingresses as needed without much hurdle.

Here follows the `value.yaml` example. 

It can have a vast number of ingresses each one starting at "name":

```jsx title="Multiple ingress objects declared in values.yaml" showLineNumbers
ingresses:
enabled: true
ingress:
    - name: ingress-1
    namespace: namespace
    annotations:
    ...
    tls:
        - hosts: my.host.com
        secretName: tls-my-host.com
    rules:
        - hosts: my.host.com
        http:
            paths:
            - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
                service:
                name: "service-name"
                port:
                    number: 80
    - name: ingress-2
```

That's it.
